          In Setswana, one of the native languages of Botswana, kamogelo means
          “to welcome”. Here at the Kamogelo Orphan and Vulnerable Children
          Project, in Mogoditshane, Botswana, we are committed to doing just
          that. Welcoming children who often have nowhere else to go.

              As of this year, the Kameglo Project is taking care of over 90
              children ranging from 21 months to 6 years of age. This number
              continues to increase as we strive to never have to turn away a
              child in need. Our mission is to provide a stigma-free environment
              for children deeply effected by the devastating and recent
              HIV/AIDS epidemic, where they can grow intellectually, physically,
              and emotionally all at no coast to the children or their families.
              We offer a wide range of services including education,
              extracurricular activities, skills training, food, clothing,
              transportation, and increased access to medical care. We recognize
              that addressing the complex needs of orphans and vulnerable
              children is a community effort.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              The story the story of the Kamogelo Project began long before the
              construction of our current building in 2005. In the wake of the
              HIV/AIDS epidemic in the mid 1990s, our sponsoring organization,
              the Tirisanyo Catholic Commission started home-based care to help
              the epidemic’s many victims. At the height of the epidemic,
              Botswana was hit particularly hard when many community members
              succumbed to the disease. As aid workers traveled from house to
              house they realized that the parents were usually too ill to
              properly take care of their children. Furthermore most of the
              homes in the area are only one room, the children were forced to
              watch their parent’s condition deteriorate all well being denied
              the proper education that young children need.<br /><br />

              The Tirisanyo Catholic Commission realized something needed to be
              done quickly. They set up a day care and school in a local 2-room
              church that had originally been a one family house. All the
              students activities were conducted outside due to limited
              capacity. Fortunately, the Rotary Club of Gaborone stepped into
              help. With generous donations from the First National Bank of
              Botswana (FNB), the United States Department of Defense, the U.S.
              European Command, the U.S. Embassy Botswana, and the People of the
              United States of America to construct a new and expansive set of
              buildings for the school in 2005. After the groundbreaking, the
              Inner Wheel Club of Gaborone donated furniture and other goods to
              help stock the school.

                Currently, the Kamogelo OVC Project depends entirely on the
                Orfund Foundation and the Tirisanyo Catholic Commission for
                running costs and bare necessities, but the generosity of
                private donors is absolutely needed for the Kamogelo Daycare
                Centre to improve and grow. We are currently looking for
                financial donations as well as donations of a wide variety of
                goods from • Food • Fuel/Petrol • Clothing • Children’s Shoes •
                Books and toys • Art and classroom supplies • Other suitable
                goods . If you or your organization is interested in partnering

                Every year since the founding of the Kamogelo Daycare Centre, we
                welcome volunteers from across the globe through our Volunteer
                Program. Previous volunteers include university students from
                Germany, USA, Sweden, Pakistan, Canada as well as numerous local
                volunteers.<br />
                In addition to our own program, the centre welcomes two
                volunteer interns from University of Pennsylvania through the
                Botswana – UPenn Partnership (USA) during the months of June,
                July and August each year. A group of nursing students from the
                same partnership perform annual examinations on all our
                children.

          We offer a wide range of services including education, extracurricular activities, skills training, food,
          clothing, transportation, and increased access to medical care. We recognize that addressing the complex needs
          of orphans and vulnerable children is a community effort.
          Our children come to the Kamogelo Project’s school from 8 am to 1
          pm every weekday. Our children start the day with a morning prayer
          that is followed by a healthy and warm breakfast. Following
          breakfast, classes and playtime persist until 12:30 when the
          children break for lunch before returning home.
          Only 5% of our children come from a home with a caregiver with
          stable work or income. It becomes essential to help feed these
          children because the 2 hot meals they receive here are often their
          only consistent meals. Families also struggle to clothe these
          children. Many only have the uniform we try distribute annually
          funds pending. Similarly the shoes we aim to distribute, when
          funds allow, are usually the child’s only shoes for the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the fact that some of the children travel up to 20 km (12
          miles) in a single day in coming to school, we offer
          transportation for many of our commuting students. We operate one
          combi-sized car (a van-like vehicle that seats about 15 adults,
          typical the region.) Unfortunately, we only have enough funds to
          employ one driver forcing our combi to make multiple trips both
          before and after classes. Steadily rising fuel costs make offering
          this service one of our largest financial burdens.<br /><br />

          We hope to continue to sustain our current offerings and be able
          to expand both our services and the amount of children that we can
          accommodate given the HIV/AIDS epidemic has effected so many
          families in our village and the surrounding areas.
